## What are the benefits to using a RESTful architectural style?
1) REST does not allow conversational states, which translates to a better ability to scale a web application. This allows a developer to add additional server nodes using a load balancer.
2) With a uniform interface, a RESTful API does not need to document extensively. This means that a developer does not need to document each resource or server for its basic operations. 
3) Using universal identifiers means that there are no customs needed to refer to resources or servers as well. To put simply, a client service does not need to understand the naming conventions used in the API, all it needs to do it listen to the server. This allow us to use uniform caching, and follows the use of conditional requests.
4) A RESTful API accepts the conventional CRUD principles, which simplifies many of the talking that happens between server and client.
