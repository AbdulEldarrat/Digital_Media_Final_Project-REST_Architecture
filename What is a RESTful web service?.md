## What is a RESTful web service?
#### The REST (Representational State Transfer)
-------

#### REST is a very imporatant architectural principle which is a pillar in web development. This principle underlines the idea that all web services should use HTTP as it was originally intended. 

#### All lookups and searhes should use `GET`
#### The mutation, creation, and deletion should use `PUT`, `POST`, and `DELETE` respectively.

*Although many developers claim that REST has no standards, I have found 4 basic pillars of REST which hold true in most cases* 
1) Exchanged messages are self-descriptive: At any point in the conversation, a message will can stand up on its own and be interpreted independently of what was sent before it or after it.
2) Resources are connected through links: every resource in a REST application is connected through hyperlinks. This makes navigation so much easier.
3) It offers access through resources : in REST servers only offer resources, which are are much easier to send back and forth between client and server.
4) Resources are represented by representations: redundant, I know. Since resources are things, we can describe those things in different formats, but REST principles outline that all systems must use the same address for each thing, differing formats are not allowed
